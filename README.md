# de-2021-midterm

This is my submission for the 2021 data engineering mid term project for the weclouddata diploma program.
The project uses multiple technologies and AWS services to create an end to end ETL data pipeline that scrapes and collects fighter data from a UFC webpage
sends it to spark for transformation and airflows the output to redshift and superset for warehousing + visualizations.
